1. Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:

A. "You." Means you the individual using the SOFTWARE as well as your employer
if you are using the SOFTWARE within the scope of your employment. If you are
using the SOFTWARE within the scope of your employment, then you represent that
you are authorized to bind your employer to this Agreement.

B. "NI." Means National Instruments Corporation, a company organized under the
laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., unless the SOFTWARE is manufactured in
the Republic of Ireland, in which event, "NI" shall mean National Instruments
Ireland Resources Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of
Ireland.  If you are not sure where the SOFTWARE is manufactured, please contact
National Instruments Corporation, 11500 N. Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas, U.S.A.
78759-3504 (Attention: Legal Department).

C. "SOFTWARE." Means all files (including, but not limited to, libraries,
modules, and programs) provided with this Agreement and which are being
installed or otherwise used. SOFTWARE includes all Upgrades that may be provided
by NI in its discretion.  NI provides certain third party software subject
to separate license terms either presented at the time of installation or
otherwise provided with the SOFTWARE ("Third Party Software").  Such Third
Party Software is not included in the definition of the term "SOFTWARE".


D. "Upgrade." Means any supplemental or replacement code for computer software
you have previously licensed from NI.


2. Grant of License. In consideration of payment of the applicable fees to NI,
NI is willing to provide you with a limited, non-exclusive right to use the
SOFTWARE, but only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
SOFTWARE is in "use" when loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed
into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, network storage device,
or other storage device). Floating, concurrent, or shared use is not permitted
under this Agreement (i.e., allocating an individual license or one seat of a volume
license to non-simultaneous use of the SOFTWARE (in whole or part) on multiple
machines). The specific use rights granted you are as follows:

You may install and use the SOFTWARE on as many computers in your workplace as
you desire; provided, however, that you separately install the SOFTWARE (using
the accompanying installer) on each such machine.

Notes. The following applies:

Source Code Component. One component of the SOFTWARE, the Kernel Abstraction
Layer ("KAL"), is provided to you in source code form. All other components of
the SOFTWARE are provided to you in object code form. You understand that you
must configure and compile the KAL for use under this Agreement. This
configuration and compilation process, however, will be completed on your behalf
by the installer.


3. Restrictions. You may not: (i) for those components of the SOFTWARE
provided in object code form, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the
SOFTWARE (except to the extent such foregoing restriction is expressly
prohibited by applicable law); (ii) sub-license, lease, lend or rent the SOFTWARE (in
whole or part); (iii) (other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement)
distribute in whole or part, modify, or create derivatives of the SOFTWARE; or
(iv) directly or indirectly, export, re-export, download, transmit, or ship the
SOFTWARE in violation of Section 17.C. or otherwise in violation of any applicable
laws or regulations, including those of the U.S., the European Union or the
jurisdiction in which you use or are downloading the SOFTWARE. Further, all uses
of the SOFTWARE shall be in accordance with the applicable documentation that
accompanies the SOFTWARE and not in any manner intended to (or that) circumvents
such documentation or the intent of this Agreement.  Under no circumstance is
"floating" or shared use permitted under this Agreement.


4. Transfer. The license rights granted hereunder are non-transferable. You may not
distribute or otherwise provide the SOFTWARE to any third party.


5. Upgrades. If the SOFTWARE is an Upgrade, you may only use the SOFTWARE if
you have (at the time you receive the Upgrade) a valid license to use the
pre-existing SOFTWARE. Further, the license agreement accompanying the Upgrade
applies to your use of the Upgrade. While you may continue to use the
pre-existing SOFTWARE, you may only use it on the same machine upon which the
Upgrade is used and the license that accompanied the pre-existing SOFTWARE will
continue to apply to your use of the pre-existing SOFTWARE.


6. Copyright; No Other Licenses. The SOFTWARE, and all copies of the SOFTWARE,
are owned by NI or its suppliers and are protected by applicable copyright laws
and international treaty provisions. The SOFTWARE, and copies thereof, are licensed
only, and are not sold or leased. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like any
other copyrighted material. You may, however, copy the SOFTWARE solely for backup
or archival purposes. In no event may you remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in the SOFTWARE. All
rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved
to NI. Further, and without limiting the foregoing, no license or any right of
any kind (whether by express license, implied license, the doctrine of
exhaustion, or otherwise) is granted under any NI patents (whether identified
herein or not) or other intellectual property right of NI with respect to any
other product(s) of NI or of any third party, including without limitation, the
right to use any of these other products.


7. Patent and Trademark Notice. For patents covering National Instruments products,
refer to the appropriate location: Help>>Patents in the SOFTWARE, the patents.txt
file on the CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or ni.com/patents. National Instruments, NI, ni.com, and
LabVIEW are trademarks of National Instruments Corporation. Refer to ni.com/trademarks
for more information about National Instruments trademarks. Further, all other product
and company names mentioned herein are (or may be) trademarks or trade names of their
respective companies.


8. Limited Warranty. NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of
ninety (90) days from the date the SOFTWARE is shipped to you  (or, if downloaded,
from the date the SOFTWARE is first downloaded by you) (i) the SOFTWARE
will (when used with the applicable NI hardware) perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying documentation, and (ii) the medium on which
the SOFTWARE is recorded will be free from defects in materials and workmanship
under normal use and service ("Limited Warranty"). Any replacement SOFTWARE will
be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30)
days, whichever is longer. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
duration of an express or implied warranty, so the above or any other limitation
provided herein may not apply to you. In such event, such warranties are limited
to the minimum warranty period allowed by applicable law. You must obtain a Return
Material Authorization number from NI before returning the SOFTWARE under
warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The
Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident,
abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (i.e.,
hardware or software) used by you which are not intended by NI
for use with the SOFTWARE, utilization of an improper hardware or software key
(if applicable), or unauthorized maintenance of the SOFTWARE.


9. Customer Remedies. NI's sole obligation (and your sole remedy) with respect
to the foregoing Limited Warranty shall be to, at NI's option, return the fees
paid by you to NI, in which case the license granted to you shall terminate without
liability on the part of NI by reason of such termination, or repair or replace
the SOFTWARE, provided that NI receives written notice of applicable defects
during the warranty period. You hereby agree not to bring an action to enforce your
remedies under the foregoing Limited Warranty, or for breach of warranty, more
than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action.


10. No Other Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, NO WARRANTIES,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM
USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATING
TO THE SOFTWARE AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR
MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE
SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND DOES
NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.


11. Intellectual Property Liability. NI shall, at its own expense, defend any
claim brought against you by a third party resulting from your use of the
SOFTWARE as authorized by your license, to the extent that such claim alleges
that the SOFTWARE infringes any patent,copyright, or trademark of such third
party protected by the laws of the U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia,
Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union, provided that such claim does not
arise from your use of the SOFTWARE in combination with equipment,devices,
software or code not made by NI, or from any modification of the SOFTWARE not
made by NI, and further provided that you notify NI in writing immediately upon
your obtaining notice of such impending claim and that you fully cooperate with
NI in preparing a defense. If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and
information NI needs to defend or settle such claim, NI shall pay any final
award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense you
incur at NI's written request, but NI shall not be liable for a settlement made
without its prior written consent. If the SOFTWARE is held to be infringing of
the rights stated above and the use thereof is enjoined NI shall, or if NI believes
the SOFTWARE may be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property
rights, NI may, at its option, either (i) procure for you the right to use the
SOFTWARE, (ii) replace or modify the SOFTWARE with other software which does not
infringe, or (iii) require that you destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and upon
such destruction NI shall refund to you the license fee payment(s) made by you
to NI for the SOFTWARE. NI'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION 11, (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO THAT OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS AND ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY)
SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.), AND IN NO EVENT SHALL
NI BE OBLIGATED UNDER THIS SECTION 11 TO INCUR OR PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, ANY
AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THIS SENTENCE. The foregoing states
your sole remedy for, and NI's entire liability and responsibility for,
infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or
industrial property right relating to the SOFTWARE. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY
IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.
THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR TO
ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE
SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER
WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.


12. Limitation On Liability. The entire liability of NI and its licensors,
distributors, and suppliers (including its and their directors, officers,
employees, and agents) is set forth above. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NI AND ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND
SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS)
BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND; ANY EXPENSES, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST BUSINESS INFORMATION; OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES,
EXCEPT DIRECT DAMAGES NOT EXCEEDING IN THE AGGREGATE THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR
THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT INVOLVED;  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES RELATING TO
THE SOFTWARE OR ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR RELATED HARDWARE, EVEN IF NI OR ITS
LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES; AND  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE
NEGLIGENCE OF NI OR OTHERS. You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices
reflect this allocation of risk. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow
the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
the above limitation may not apply. If the foregoing limitation of liability is
not enforceable because the SOFTWARE, the Third Party Software, the services, or
the hardware is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final,
non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly caused bodily injury,
death, or property damage, in no event shall the aggregate liability
of NI, its licensors, distributors, and suppliers  for property damage exceed the
greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or the license paid for the SOFTWARE.


13. Warning. (1) NI PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR
A LEVEL OF RELIABILITY SUITABLE FOR USE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH SURGICAL
IMPLANTS OR AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN ANY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHOSE FAILURE TO
PERFORM CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY TO A HUMAN. (2)
IN ANY APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE ABOVE, RELIABILITY OF OPERATION OF THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE IMPAIRED BY ADVERSE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO FLUCTUATIONS IN ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY, COMPUTER HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS,
COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FITNESS, FITNESS OF COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT
SOFTWARE USED TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION, INSTALLATION ERRORS, SOFTWARE AND
HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC
MONITORING OR CONTROL DEVICES, TRANSIENT FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
(HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), UNANTICIPATED USES OR MISUSES, OR ERRORS ON THE PART
OF THE USER OR APPLICATIONS DESIGNER (ADVERSE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE ARE
HEREAFTER COLLECTIVELY TERMED "SYSTEM FAILURES"). ANY APPLICATION WHERE A SYSTEM
FAILURE WOULD CREATE A RISK OF HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS (INCLUDING THE RISK
OF BODILY INJURY AND DEATH) SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT SOLELY UPON ONE FORM OF
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM DUE TO THE RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE. TO AVOID DAMAGE, INJURY, OR
DEATH, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MUST TAKE REASONABLY PRUDENT STEPS TO
PROTECT AGAINST SYSTEM FAILURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BACK-UP OR SHUT
DOWN MECHANISMS. BECAUSE EACH END-USER SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM
NI'S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI
PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR
CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS
ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS, AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION.


14. U.S. Government Rights. The SOFTWARE is a "commercial item" developed
exclusively at private expense, consisting of "commercial computer  software"
and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are defined or
used in the applicable U.S. acquisition regulations. If you are an agency,
department, or other entity of the United States Government, the SOFTWARE is
licensed hereunder (i) only as a commercial item and (ii) with only those rights
as are granted to all other licensees pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. You agree not to use, duplicate, or disclose the SOFTWARE in any
way not expressly permitted by this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement
requires NI to produce or furnish technical data for or to you.


15. Compliance. You agree to make all applicable records available for review
by NI during your normal business hours so as to permit NI (upon reasonable
notice to you) to verify your compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Further, if you are a business or other entity, you agree that upon
the request of NI or NI's authorized representative, you will promptly document
and certify in writing to NI that your and your employees' use of the SOFTWARE
complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. NI may (upon written
notice) inspect your use of the SOFTWARE during your normal business hours to
ensure your compliance with this Agreement. If the results of any such
inspection indicate the underpayment by you of applicable fees due and payable
to NI, you shall (i) immediately pay such amounts to NI and (ii) reimburse NI
for the cost of such inspection.


16. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon failure by
you to comply with its terms. Upon termination of this Agreement, regardless of
the reason, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE.


17. General.

A. If the SOFTWARE is manufactured in the Republic of Ireland, (1) (i) this
Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland, exclusive of
any provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale
of Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii)
the non-exclusive venue for all actions under this Agreement shall be in
the courts located in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland and the parties agree
to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts; otherwise (2) (i) this Agreement
is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., exclusive of any
provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of
Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii) the
non-exclusive venue for all actions under this Agreement shall be in the
courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A. and the parties agree to
submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.

B. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between you and NI
regarding the SOFTWARE and supersedes any oral or written proposals, prior
agreements, purchase orders, or any other communication between you and
NI relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No delay or omission
by NI to exercise any right or power it has under this Agreement shall
impair or be construed as a waiver of such right or power. A waiver by
NI of any breach of any provision hereof shall not be construed to be a
waiver of any succeeding breach of that provision or of any breach of any
other provision. No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless
set forth in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of you
and NI. If any action is brought by either party to this Agreement against
the other regarding the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover, in addition to any relief granted, reasonable attorney fees
and court costs. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the
offending clause will be modified so as to be enforceable and, as modified,
shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in
full force and effect.

C. The SOFTWARE is, and Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE
may be, subject to control under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations
(15 CFR Part 730 et. seq.), other applicable U.S. export control laws and
regulations, and applicable global export control laws and regulations,
including, for products exported from the European Union, the Council Regulation
(EC) No. 428/2009 (the "Regulation") and the Hungarian Government Decree
No. 50/2004 (III. 23.). You agree that you will not export, re-export or
transfer any SOFTWARE or Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE
via any means to any prohibited destination, entity or individual without the
required export license(s) or authorization(s) from the U.S. Government
and/or other applicable export licensing authority. NI reserves the right
not to ship or permit downloading of the SOFTWARE ordered if, at any time,
NI believes that such shipment or downloading of such SOFTWARE or any Third Party
Software provided by NI with such Software may violate U.S. and/or other
applicable export control laws. If you are downloading the SOFTWARE, you
hereby represent and warrant to NI as follows: (i) you are not located in,
or under the control of, any country the laws and regulations of which prohibit
importation of the SOFTWARE or any Third Party Software provided by NI with the
SOFTWARE; and (ii) you are not located in, or under the control of, any country
to which the laws and regulations of the U.S. and/or other applicable export
control laws prohibit exportation of the SOFTWARE or any such Thurd Party Software.

AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE
"DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THIS INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.

Readers of this document are requested to submit to Interchangeable Virtual
Instruments, Inc. (Licensor), with their comments, notification of any relevant
patent rights or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware
which might be infringed by any use of this intellectual property, software, or
specification (the Intellectual Property), as appropriate, and to provide
supporting documentation.

Copyright (C) 2002, Interchangeable Virtual Instruments Foundation, Inc. All
Rights Reserved. IVI Foundation is the exclusive licensee of the IVI trademark
and the Interchangeable Virtual Instruments Foundation, Inc. logo.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this
Intellectual Property may be the subject of patent or other intellectual
property right (collectively, "IPR") of third parties. LICENSOR shall not be
responsible now or in the future for identifying any or all such IPR.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge and subject to the terms set forth
below, to any person obtaining a copy of this Intellectual Property and any
associated documentation, to deal in the Intellectual Property without
restriction (except as set forth below), including without limitation the
rights to implement, use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and/or
sublicense copies of the Intellectual Property, and to permit persons to whom
the Intellectual Property is furnished to do so, provided that the above
copyright notice(s) appear in all copies of the Intellectual Property and that
each person to whom the Intellectual Property is furnished agrees to the terms
of this Agreement. If you are not a member of LICENSOR, your license hereunder
is limited to the use of the object code of the Intellectual Property. If you
are a member of LICENSOR, your license extends to the source code of the
Intellectual Property.

If you modify the Intellectual Property, all copies of the modified
Intellectual Property must include, in addition to the above copyright notice,
a notice that the Intellectual Property includes modifications that have not
been approved or adopted by LICENSOR.

You may not charge for any sublicense of the Intellectual Property; provided
however, that the Intellectual Property may be sublicensed together with
another product so long as there is no separate charge for the Intellectual
Property.

THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS. THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR HOLDERS INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE DO NOT
WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL MEET
YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. ANY USE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SHALL BE MADE
ENTIRELY AT THE USERS OWN RISK. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY
CONTRIBUTOR OF IPR TO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, OR ANY
DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
RESULTING FROM ANY ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS,
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION, USE, COMMERCIALIZATION
OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

This license is effective until terminated. You may terminate it at any time by
destroying the Intellectual Property together with all copies in any form. It
will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this
Agreement. Except as provided in the following sentence, no such termination of
this license shall require the termination of any third party end-user
sublicense to the Intellectual Property which is in force as of the date of
notice of such termination. In addition, should the Intellectual Property, or
the operation of the Intellectual Property, infringe, or in LICENSOR's sole
opinion be likely to infringe, any patent, copyright, trademark or other right
of a third party, you agree that LICENSOR, in its sole discretion, may
terminate this license without any compensation or liability to you, your
licensees or any other party. You agree upon termination of any kind to destroy
or cause to be destroyed the Intellectual Property together with all copies in
any form, whether held by you or by any third party.

Except as contained in this notice, the name of a copyright holder shall not be
used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings in
this Intellectual Property without prior written authorization of the copyright
holder. LICENSOR is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may
authorize you or any third party to use certification marks, trademarks or
other special designations to indicate compliance with any LICENSOR standards
or specifications.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The
application to this Agreement of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded. In the event any
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unenforceable, void or invalid,
such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid and enforceable, and as
so modified the entire Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No
decision, action or inaction by LICENSOR shall be construed to be a waiver of
any rights or remedies available to it.

The Intellectual Property is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 12.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire the Intellectual Property with only those rights set forth herein.

None of the Intellectual Property or underlying information or technology may
be downloaded or otherwise exported or reexported in violation of U.S. export
laws and regulations. In addition, you are responsible for complying with any
local laws in your jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, export
or use the Intellectual Property, and you represent that you have complied with
any regulations or registration procedures required by applicable law to make
this license enforceable.
